# vegas
This code is from a project I used to map conversations about 2017 Las Vegas shooting.

Here's an overview of the key scripts:

tweedy: a simple module I made for converting Twitter data to tidy dataframes.

vegas: a module with specialized functions for the data pipelines in this project.

template for seeding process: high level script that conducts a full iteration of the data pipeline (using custom functions from the previous two modules)

auto reporting template: creates an automated report of an iteration of the data pipeline
